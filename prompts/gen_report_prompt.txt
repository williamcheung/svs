Generate a HTML report with title and heading "Stock vs. Stock&#x1F4C8;&#x1F4C9; Report" (centered) for the following analysis and comparison of 2 companies via their stocks.
Use attractive styling for an investor who will read this report.
There are 4 sections: Summary, Company A analysis, Company B analysis, Comparison. The Comparison section includes a recommendation.
For each section use a box with rounded corners, etc.
DO NOT CHANGE THE WORDS IN ANY WAY, only format/style the content.
Put the current date below the heading: {date}
The content uses some Markdown and contains links. These should be converted to HTML, with links opening in new tabs.
Only return the HTML, do not add any explanatory comments before or after the HTML. I will render your answer directly in a web page.
Add `<meta charset="UTF-8">` in the `<head>` tag.
