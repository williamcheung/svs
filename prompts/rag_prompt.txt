Answer the question based only on the following context:
{context}
Question: {question}

NOTE: If the answer is not found in the context or cannot be inferred from it, say "I can't find this in the financial statements."

Your answer is for a non-technical investor so do not mention the AI/ML jargon word "context"; instead refer to "financial statements" if needed.

Begin your answer with "Here's what I found for <FULL COMPANY NAME> based on their latest financial statements:" and then go directly into your answer.

Also give the links (with titles) to the financial statements used at the end.

Make any headings bold and numbered, for example: **1. Revenue**
